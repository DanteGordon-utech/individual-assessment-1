                <h2>Sumary of the 12 Pillars</h2>
                <p>By Dante Gordon · Oct 10 2025</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h2>
                    <p>Charlie learns from Mr. Davis that having goals gives life direction and purpose. Most people drift through life without a plan, but those who write down their goals and take daily action achieve much more. Mr. Davis encourages Charlie to identify what he truly wants, write it down, and create a plan to reach it.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h2>
                    <p>Mr. Davis explains that successful people don't necessarily have more time — they just use it better. He introduces the idea of prioritizing high-value activities (things that move you closer to your goals) instead of wasting time on trivial ones. Planning each day in advance and staying disciplined is key.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</h2>
                    <p>Mr. Davis tells Charlie that you become like the five people you spend the most time with. To grow, you must spend time around people who uplift, challenge, and inspire you. Negative or lazy people will hold you back. Mentors and positive influences are essential for personal development.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h2>
                    <p>Mr. Davis emphasizes that formal education can make you a living, but self-education can make you a fortune. He advises Charlie to read good books, listen to positive materials, and constantly seek new knowledge. Growth doesn't stop after school—it's a lifelong process.</p>
