            <h2>My Top 3 Strengths</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>1. Analytical Thinking</h2>
                <p>I enjoy breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. In programming, this means carefully planning the **logic and data structures** before writing code. This approach ensures cleaner solutions and significantly reduces debugging time, especially when dealing with nested functions or complex API interactions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>2. Resourcefulness</h2>
                <p>When faced with a challenge I don't immediately know how to solve, I excel at finding and synthesizing information from multiple sources—documentation, forums, and tutorials. I quickly adapt and implement new concepts, which is crucial in the fast-paced environment of **modern web development**.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>3. Detail-Oriented</h2>
                <p>I am highly focused on the small details, from ensuring **pixel-perfect alignment in CSS** to meticulously checking for edge cases in JavaScript functions. This trait ensures that the final product is robust, user-friendly, and meets all technical specifications without unexpected bugs or layout shifts.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration: My Hero</h2>
            <div>
                <div id="quote">
                    <p>"The best way to predict the future is to create it."</p>
                </div>
                <p>- Hero Name</p>

                <div id="Background">
                    <p>Bakground: Hero Name</p>
                    <p>Peter Drucker (1909–2005) was an Austrian-American management consultant, educator, and author whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business corporation. Often called the "founder of modern management," he stressed the importance of **innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic planning.**

This quote resonates with me because it reframes my educational journey—it emphasizes that learning to code isn't just about adapting to the future, but actively building it through my projects and development skills.</p>
