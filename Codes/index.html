                <p>Is there any better feeling that spending 4 hours solving a problem that you could have solved in 5 minutes if you just read the documentation... No? I thought so</p>
                <p>I do enjoy this because I can just sit back and create something. What is more fun than using logic to build something?</p>
                <p>Reading?? nah too much things are "left up to interpretation", like bro just say what you mean.</p>
