                <h2>Coding</h2>
                <p>Is there any better feeling that spending 4 hours solving a problem that you could have solved in 5 minutes if you just read the documentation... No? I thought so</p>
                <p>I do enjoy this because I can just sit back and create something. What is more fun than using logic to build something?</p>
                <p>Reading?? nah too much things are "left up to interpretation", like bro just say what you mean.</p>

            <h2>My Top 3 Strengths</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>1. Analytical Thinking</h2>
                <p>Once a problem is logical, I will solve it. Be it Math, Computer Science etc.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>2. Resourcefulness</h2>
                <p>When faced with a challenge I don't immediately know how to solve, I excel at finding and synthesizing information from multiple sources. I quickly adapt and implement new concepts</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>3. Detail-Oriented</h2>
                <p>I am highly focused on the small details, from ensuring **pixel-perfect alignment in CSS** to meticulously checking for edge cases in JavaScript functions. This trait ensures that the final product is robust, user-friendly, and meets all technical specifications without unexpected bugs or layout shifts.</p>

                <p>- Hero Name</p>

                <div id="Background">
                <p class="hero">Peter Drucker (1909–2005) was an Austrian-American management consultant, educator, and author whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business corporation. Often called the "founder of modern management," he stressed the importance of **innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic planning.**

This quote resonates with me because it reframes my educational journey—it emphasizes that learning to code isn't just about adapting to the future, but actively building it through my projects and development skills.</p>
